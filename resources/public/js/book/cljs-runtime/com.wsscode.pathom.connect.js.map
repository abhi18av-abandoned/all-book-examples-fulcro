It works by wrapping the parser,\n  it setups the connect resolver and mutation dispatch using the embedded dispatchers (check resolver\n  map format in the book for more details). It also sets up the resolver weights for load\n  balacing calculation. Here are the available options to configure the plugin:\n\n  `::pc/indexes` - provide an index atom to be used, otherwise the plugin will create one\n  `::pc/register` - a resolver, mutation or sequence of resolvers/mutations to register in\n  the index\n  `::pc/pool-chan` - override the thread pool, use `nil` to disable thread pool feature (not recommneded)\n\n  This plugin also looks for the key `::pc/register` in the other plugins used in the\n  parser configuration, this enable plugins to provide resolvers/mutations to be available\n  in your connect system.\n\n  By default this plugin will also register resolvers to provide the index itself, if\n  you for some reason need to hide it you can dissoc the `::pc/register` from the output\n  and they will not be available, but consider that doing so you lose the ability to\n  have instrospection in tools like Pathom Viz and Fulcro Inspect.\"\n  ([] (connect-plugin {}))\n  ([{::keys [indexes] :as env}]\n   (let [indexes   (or indexes (atom {}))\n         pool-chan (get env ::pool-chan)]\n     {::p/wrap-parser2\n      (fn connect-wrap-parser [parser {::p/keys [plugins]}]\n        (let [plugin-registry  (keep ::register plugins)\n              resolver-weights (atom {})]\n          (swap! indexes register [plugin-registry (get env ::register [])])\n          (fn [env tx]\n            (parser\n              (merge\n                {::resolver-dispatch resolver-dispatch-embedded\n                 ::mutate-dispatch   mutation-dispatch-embedded\n                 ::indexes           @indexes\n                 ::resolver-weights  resolver-weights\n                 ::pool-chan         pool-chan}\n                env) tx))))\n\n      ::indexes\n      indexes\n\n      ::register\n      connect-resolvers})))\n"]}
